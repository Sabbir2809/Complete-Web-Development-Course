          <p class="card-text">
            The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
            Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
            Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable
            can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared. Variables
            declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have
            scope to the immediate enclosing block.

          <p class="card-text">
            An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature
            introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both
            regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are
            some differences between them. Let's see the differences below: Syntax, Arguments
            ,binding, Use of this keyword, Using a new keyword

          <h3 class="card-title">JavaScript Template Literals (Template Strings)</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Template literals are a new feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015/ ES6. It provides an
            easy way to create multiline strings and perform string interpolation. Template literals
            are the string literals and allow embedded expressions. Before ES6, template literals
            were called as template strings. Unlike quotes in strings, template literals are
            enclosed by the backtick (` `) character (key below the ESC key in QWERTY keyboard).
            Template literals can contain placeholders, which are indicated by the dollar sign and
            curly braces ($(expression}). Inside the backticks, if we want to use an expression,
            then we can place that expression in the ($(expression}).
