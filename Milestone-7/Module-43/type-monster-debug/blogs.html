                  Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage
                </h3>
                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  <strong>Local storage</strong> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger
                  amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is
                  closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access
                  later, such as offline data.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  <strong>Session storage</strong> is similar to cookies, but the data is only
                  stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the
                  user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is
                  sensitive, such as login credentials.

                  Difference between Global scope and Block scope
                </h3>
                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  <strong>Global Scope: </strong> The variables defined outside of any function or
                  curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope
                  means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                  function or conditional state can access that variable.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  <strong>Local Scope: </strong> If you were to define some variables inside curly
                  brackets {} or inside a specific function then those variables are called local
                  variables The local variables have a very confined scope which is called the local
                  scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into
                  two different scopes:

                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  The Event Loop is responsible for executing the JavaScript code. It first
                  evaluates and executes the script, then processes Tasks and Microtasks.Tasks and
                  Microtasks are scheduled, synchronous blocks of code. They are executed one at a
                  time, and are placed in the Task Queue and Microtask Queue, respectively.For all
                  of these, the Call Stack is used to keep track of function calls.Whenever
                  Microtasks are executed, the Microtask Queue must be emptied out before the next
                  Task can be executed. Rendering occurs between Tasks, but not between Microtasks.

                <p class="card-text text-start">
                  JavaScript provides some primitive as well as non-primitive data types. For
                  example “null”, “boolean”, “undefined”, etc. belong to the primitive data type
                  while “arrays”, and “objects” are non-primitive or complex data types. In
                  JavaScript, any variable that is not assigned with any value has a default value
                  of “undefined”.
